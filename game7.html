        <h2>Tactical First-Person Shooter (FPS), Multiplayer
        </h2>
        <p>Valorant is a free-to-play tactical FPS game developed by Riot Games, the creators of League of Legends. Players are divided into two teams: Attackers and Defenders. The Attackers must plant a bomb (called a "Spike") at a designated site, while the Defenders must prevent them from doing so or defuse the Spike if it's already been planted.
